# Markdown Best Practices for Content Creation

Markdown has become the standard for writing content on the web. Whether you're creating documentation, blog posts, or README files, following markdown best practices will make your content more readable and maintainable.

## Headers and Structure

Use headers to create a clear hierarchy in your content:

```markdown
# Main Title (H1)
## Section Title (H2)
### Subsection Title (H3)
#### Sub-subsection Title (H4)
```

**Best Practice**: Use only one H1 per document and maintain a logical hierarchy.

## Lists and Organization

### Unordered Lists

Use asterisks, plus signs, or hyphens for unordered lists:

```markdown
- First item
- Second item
  - Nested item
  - Another nested item
- Third item
```

### Ordered Lists

Number your ordered lists:

```markdown
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step
```

## Links and References

### Inline Links

```markdown
[Link text](https://example.com)
```

### Reference Links

For better readability, use reference links:

```markdown
[Link text][reference]

[reference]: https://example.com "Optional title"
```

## Images

Include images with alt text for accessibility:

```markdown
![Alt text](image.jpg "Optional title")
```

## Code Blocks

### Inline Code

Use backticks for inline code:

```markdown
Use the `npm install` command to install packages.
```

### Code Blocks

Use triple backticks for code blocks:

```javascript
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```

## Emphasis and Formatting

- **Bold**: `**text**` or `__text__`
- *Italic*: `*text*` or `_text_`
- ***Bold Italic***: `***text***`
- ~~Strikethrough~~: `~~text~~`

## Tables

Create tables for structured data:

```markdown
| Header 1 | Header 2 | Header 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Cell 1   | Cell 2   | Cell 3   |
| Cell 4   | Cell 5   | Cell 6   |
```

## Blockquotes

Use blockquotes for quotes or important information:

```markdown
> This is a blockquote.
> 
> It can span multiple lines.
```

## Horizontal Rules

Use horizontal rules to separate sections:

```markdown
---

or

***
```

## Front Matter

When using markdown with static site generators like 11ty, include front matter at the top:

```markdown
---
title: Your Title
date: 2024-01-20
tags: [tag1, tag2]
description: Brief description
---

# Your Content Here
```
